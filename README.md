# TeamPomodoro
Project created in order to migrate the Team Pomodoro app to the Kotlin language. The application has been created in 2017 to use some Firebase tools and practice some concepts. The purpose here is to create the application from scratch with my current knowledge and make a comparison of the evolution of the initial version.
